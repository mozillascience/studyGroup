## Image Processing in Python

This is an introductory tutorial on image processing using Python packages. We will understand image data types, manipulate and prepare images for analysis such as image segmentation.


### In this tutorial, we will learn:

* to load images and extract basic statistics
* image data types
* image preprocessing and manipulation
* image segmentation

### Useful links for image processing libraries

* [skimage](http://scikit-image.org/) Sklearn's image package
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) Open Source Computer Vision library
* [mahotas](http://mahotas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Computer Vision in Python


### Packages to be installed

* `numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy`
* `cv2`: pip install opencv-python
* `PIL`: pip install PILLOW
