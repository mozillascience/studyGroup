# Carpentry@UiO Study Group

Welcome to [Carpentry@UiO](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/)'s Study Group!

## What is the 'Study Group'?

The StudyGroup is part of the Carpentry@UiO community of people who share a passion and enthusiasm for teaching researchers, students, and everyone else the fundamentals of coding, data management, and digital literacy. Our StudyGroup members have a diverse background, with disciplines such as bioinformatics, psychology, computer science, engineering, humanities, geology, and social sciences. We are also an international group - our working language is English, and everyone is welcome to join!

## New to the Study Group?

<!-- * **Join our Gitter? Chat:** We use an online ??? to connect and share resources and ideas (you can sign in with GitHub, or using a Twitter ID if you're not set up on GitHub just yet). If you'd like to say hello, please introduce yourself in the chat, tell us where you are, and what you're thinking about or planning for your new Study Group. We're looking forward to meeting you. -->

* **Come to a Meeting:** We are meeting usually once per week with a dedicated topic or theme, but we are happy to give any new member or interested person an orientation tour. Drop by on date that suits you: it’s a great opportunity to meet, network, and share ideas with others and the Carpentry@UiO community.  If you’re interested in joining us, drop by or send an message to @annefou or @arockenberger or any other member of the StudyGroup.

* **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules]() <!-- insert link to Code of Conduct created by the Interim Board --> that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!

* **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).

* **Join our Zotero Group Library:** we use a [Zotero group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2375861/uio-carpentry-study-group) that is public, but with closed membership for sharing interesting articles, blog posts, websites, books etc. If you are participating in the Book Club, all their material will be shared in the group library, too. In order to join the group library, send a PM to StudyGroup member @evezeyl.
